Mercury Syntax Highlighting Under Vim 6.0

1. Create a diretory `~/.vim':

	$ mkdir ~/.vim

2. Copy everything recursively from this directory into `~/.vim':

	$ cp -r . ~/.vim

IMPORTANT: If you already have a file `~/.vim/after/filetype.vim' then you
should copy the files from this directory one by one, except for
`after/filetype.vim' which you should append to your own
`~/.vim/after/filetype.vim'.

3. Ensure you have the following lines in your `~/.vimrc' file:

	filetype on
	filetype plugin on
	syntax enable

4. If you wish to change the colour scheme used by Vim's syntax highlighting,
we suggest you put the necessary commands in `~/.vim/colors/mycolours.vim'
and append the following to the above list of commands in your `~/.vimrc':

	colors mycolours

4. Vim will load `~/.vim/syntax/mercury.vim' and `~/.vim/ftplugin/mercury.vim'
automatically when opening a .m or .moo file.

The syntax file describes two options you may wish to alter from your
`~/.vimrc' file.

The ftplugin file defines a number of useful keyboard mappings you may wish to
consider.
