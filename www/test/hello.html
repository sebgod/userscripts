        <p>My name is Doctor Womac and I am going to teach you all about chemical formulae.
        A chemical formula is a way to describe the chemical elements that make up a particular chemical compound.
        It consists of chemical symbols to covey the elements and numbers to show the number of atoms of each element.
        H<span class="atoms">2</span>SO<span class="atoms">4</span> is the chemical formula for sulphuric acid, for example.
        The charge of an ion can be displayed in superscript, such as Au<span class="charge">2+</span>.
        This concludes my lesson.
        I must rush off home now because I have a problem with some radioactive phosphate.</p>
